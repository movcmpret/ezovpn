# 'I want to know what I am doing' guide
__Important:__ Unfortunately, ezOVPN needs to be executed as root, because it is interacting with the OpenVPN CLI, which creates a TUN/TAP interface and a local TCP server called [Management Interface](https://openvpn.net/community-resources/management-interface/). If you're uncomfortable with it, just give the executing user permissions to openvpn and you should be fine without running the whole software as root.

The `preconditions.sh` script installs the latest openVPN client via apt, creates an executable script, which basically only executes `java -jar /path/to/jarfile.jar` and a symlink in /usr/bin/ezovpn to this script. Furthermore, it enables all users to execute it as sudo, which is perhaps a vulnerability in your system.

__ezOVPN is still an unstable and insecure software, so please be careful and don't use this software, unless you operate on a safe environment. Keep in mind, that you use this software at your own risk. It is provided without any kind of warranty.__

# Troubleshooting
There are several common problems that may occur. 

## Java: "Cannot find Mainclass com.movcmpret..."
This error mostly occurs, because the destination system has no JavaFX support. Unfortunately, there still exist some packaging problems with maven, which is why you need to install the required libs for JavaFX manually. Since this runs with Java 8 following apt packages are required (For Ubuntu; Please check for similar packages in for your dist): 

- openjfx=8u161-b12-1ubuntu2
- libopenjfx-jni=8u161-b12-1ubuntu2
- libopenjfx-java=8u161-b12-1ubuntu2
